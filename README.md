# PuzzleNode Solutions

My solutions in Ruby to all 12 of the excellent [PuzzleNode programming challenges](http://puzzlenode.com/). I'm currently on the [leaderboard](http://puzzlenode.com/leaderboard) (look for Steve Morris).

## Disclaimer

Since developing these solutions, I've participated in and graduated from [Ruby Mendicant University](http://http://university.rubymendicant.com/alumni/recent.html). My current Ruby skills are far more advanced than what's shown here.

These current solutions are more like scripts, and they don't follow many Ruby best practices I've applied in later projects. Some day I may rewrite these solutions.

## Hints

To efficiently solve many of these challenges, you'll need to be comfortable with both recursion and graph theory. I found [this article](http://www.python.org/doc/essays/graphs) extremely helpful for implementing graphs (translating the Python code to Ruby was straightforward).

## Requirements

Ruby 1.9.2 or higher

Gems required by one or more solutions:

* RSpec (`gem install rspec`)
* Nokogiri (`gem install nokogiri`)
