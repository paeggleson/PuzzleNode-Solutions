# PuzzleNode Solutions

This is where I'll be posting my solutions in Ruby to all 12 of the excellent [PuzzleNode programming challenges](http://puzzlenode.com/). I'm currently on the [leaderboard](http://puzzlenode.com/leaderboard) (look for Steve Morris).

Each challenge solution is in its own folder. I've included usage and implementation notes at the top of each solution's .rb file.

## Requirements

You need Ruby 1.9.2 installed to run these solutions. To test against the sample data set provided with each challenge, you'll need the RSpec gem installed (`gem install rspec`).

A few of the solutions require additional gems. These are listed in each solution's .rb file.
